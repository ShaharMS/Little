# Little

### What is it?

**Little** is a simple programming language that can be used to teach children how to program.

Because of the minimal and simple nature of this language, you don't have to write it's source code specifically in English.

The language itself is cross-platform, as it can compile to haxe. it also bundles its own interpreter.

### Why does that exist?

Other than teaching, the language has a lot of benefits, some I already mentioned before:

 - cross platform
 - small bundle size
 - fast interpreter
 - Multilingual coding
 - interfaces with external H‚Åπaxe code (Haxe transpiler only)
 - makes it easy to implement code interfacing in games
 - Understandable errors that actually explain what went wrong and where
 - easy and accurate access to runtime details & definition values

## Syntax

The language is very minimal by design, and only has a couple of reserved words:

**Notice - the language is still in development, syntax may change in the future**

 - **`define`** - used for defining variables.
 - **`action`** - used for defining functions.
 - **`as`** - used for expression typing, for example: `define x as Number`
 - **`return`** used for returning action values.
 - **`nothing`** - the language's `null` value.

The resereved words' translations may change a bit across different languages to make programming more intuitive, and to keep the same code structure.
